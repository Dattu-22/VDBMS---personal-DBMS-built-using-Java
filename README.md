# VDBMS---personal-DBMS-built-using-Java
This is a Java DBMS project which supports table creation, data manipulation and index management using B+ Trees.
Certainly! Here’s a sample **README.md** file tailored to your Java DBMS project featuring table management and B+ Tree indexing. You can customize it further as needed.

## Features

- Table creation and management with custom data storage
- B+ Tree based indexing for efficient data retrieval
- Basic query support and data manipulation operations
- Modular design to add new features easily
- Educational project showcasing core DBMS concepts implemented from scratch

## Tech Stack

- Java (JDK 8 or higher)
- No external libraries required (pure Java implementation)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository (if from GitHub):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dattu-22/VDBMS---personal-DBMS-built-using-Java.git
   cd vdbms
   ```

2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. Run the main class:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

## Usage

- Use the CLI or configured classes to create tables, insert data, and query records.
- The B+ Tree indexing enhances performance for large datasets and range queries.

## Project Structure

- `Main.java` — Entry point of the project
- `Table.java` — Represents tables and handles table operations
- `BPlusTree.java` — Implementation of B+ Tree for indexing
- Other helper classes and utilities supporting DBMS functionality
